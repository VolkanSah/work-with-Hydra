## Installation
To install Hydra, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra
    ```
2. Change to the Hydra directory:

    ```
3. Compile Hydra:
    ```sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    ```

## Usage
Hydra can be used to perform brute-force attacks on various services. Here is a basic usage example:

```sh
hydra -L username_list.txt -P password_list.txt target_ip ssh
```

## Examples
Here are some pseudocode examples to illustrate how Hydra can be used:

### Example 1: SSH Brute Force
```pseudo
// Define the target IP and the protocol
target_ip = "192.168.1.1"
protocol = "ssh"

// Define the username and password lists
username_list = ["admin", "user", "test"]
password_list = ["password123", "admin", "123456"]

// Execute the brute force attack
hydra -L username_list -P password_list target_ip protocol
```

### Example 2: FTP Brute Force
```pseudo
// Define the target IP and the protocol
target_ip = "192.168.1.2"
protocol = "ftp"

// Define the username and password lists
username_list = ["ftpuser", "anonymous"]
password_list = ["ftp123", "anonymous"]

// Execute the brute force attack
hydra -L username_list -P password_list target_ip protocol
```

### Example 3: Web Form Brute Force
```pseudo
// Define the target URL and the protocol
target_url = "http://example.com/login"
protocol = "http-post-form"

// Define the username and password lists
username_list = ["admin", "user"]
password_list = ["admin123", "password"]

// Define the login form parameters
form_parameters = "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid username or password"

// Execute the brute force attack
hydra -L username_list -P password_list target_url protocol form_parameters
```

## Best Practices
- Always ensure you have permission before performing any brute-force attacks.
- Use strong and unique passwords to protect your own systems.
- Regularly update Hydra to benefit from the latest features and security updates.
